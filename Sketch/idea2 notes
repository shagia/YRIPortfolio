The Youth Radio portfolio is a timeline based page that plots each YRI project on a basic timeline. Functionality wise, there's not much to talk about I don't think. The bare timeline it's self would be a responsive timeline based on either Timeline.js (https://timeline.knightlab.com/#examples) or vis.js (http://visjs.org/index.html#modules), whichever is more flexible in styling since the most critical factor here would be styling, I believe.

The mobile UI consists of a collapse menu and logo (A), the timeline (B), the timeline's plots (C), and the legal information (D).

The timeline would be able to be swiped left and right. I haven't thought about zooming in and out but it wouldn't be something difficult to add into the UI, I think both timeline libraries are able to zoom in and out with mouse and hands input though.

The plot points on the timeline are outlined with the YR color. It includes a marker under it (may not happen but there's no reason the outline plot can't) with the name of the project. You simply just tap / click it.

Clicking a plot point would bring up the 'sidebar', but in the center of the screen. The top image would be a screenshot of the project, and it's clickable 

Clicking the collapse menu / logo just slides down the two options from the existing YR site: Back To Youth Radio, and Our Blog. It's small making it able to just be a two button function: you click and choose, or you click and click the logo again.
